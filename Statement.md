# Project Statement: Student Admission Data Collector

## Overview
The **Student Admission Data Collector** is a Python-based console application designed to store, manage, and retrieve student admission information. It allows institutions to maintain records in an organized and persistent manner using basic Python features such as file handling, classes, and user interaction through menus.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a simple yet effective admission data management system that:
- Automatically generates a unique Admission ID.
- Allows users to enter and store student details.
- Maintains student data in a persistent text file.
- Enables viewing and searching of existing records.
- Demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including OOP, file handling, functions, loops, and conditionals.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions often require a basic system to record and track student admissions. Manual record-keeping can lead to misplaced information, difficulty in searching, and challenges in long-term data management.  
This project provides a computer-based solution to:
- Reduce manual work  
- Improve data accessibility  
- Organize records in a structured format  
- Enable fast retrieval of information by Admission ID  

## Scope
This project includes:
- A menu-driven system  
- New admission entries  
- Viewing all stored records  
- Searching records by ID  
- Text-file based storage  

The system does *not* currently include:
- Editing or deleting records  
- Data validation  
- GUI or database integration  
These can be added as future enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- File handling (`txt` file)  
- Standard Python libraries  

## Expected Output
- A working console application  
- A generated `admissions.txt` file containing structured student information  
- A user-friendly menu for navigation
